# Geometry
This module covers most aspects related to geometry, such as vectors an 3D analytic geometry itself.

## Vectors
There is a utility for pure vector calculations. It currently has vector **dot** ($`\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v}`$), **crossed** ($`\vec{u} \wedge \vec{v}`$) and **mixed** ($`[\vec{u},\vec{v},\vec{w}]`$) product. When $`\vec{u} = (2,-1,3)`$ it will be introduced in the tool as `2,-1,3`.
